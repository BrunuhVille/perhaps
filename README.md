PerHapS is a new and simple approach to directly call haplotypes from short-read, paired-end WES data

1. download UKB pre-phased genetic data

2. download UKB WES data through a look, extract a certain genetic region such as APOE to save storage space

3. run Perhaps.sh to piece together haplotypes from WES

4. run Perhaps.R and more analyses to explore the haplotypes
